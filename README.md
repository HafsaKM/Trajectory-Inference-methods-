# Trajectory-Inference-methods-
This contains part of the methods of my 1st year CDT dissertation submitted for an MRES.

Seven TI methods were used to analyse the Crinier et al (2021) NK single cell dataset.
All scripts used to implement and test these methods on this dataset is made available here.

The wishbone package by Setty et al (2016) was edited to use the latent space for its waypoint calculations and bifurcation point identification. The edited package is also uploaded here.
